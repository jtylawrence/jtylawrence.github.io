> These projects are any mathematical related things I have done that are not directly related to coursework. Any past, current, or upcoming projects can be found here. 

## Current

I am currently reading through chapters 2 and 3 of [*Mathematical Theory of Scattering Resonances*](https://bookstore.ams.org/gsm-200/) by S. Dyatlov and M. Zworksi. Any notes and/or exercise I write will be found here. 

## Past

In Summer 2025, I (partially) worked through *Methods of Modern Mathematical Physics I: Functional Analysis* by M. Reed and B. Simon. Some notes I have taken can be found here, and exercise I have completed can be found here.
