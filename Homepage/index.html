<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am a second year PhD student at the <a href="https://math.missouri.edu/">University of Missouri</a>. Primarily, I am interested in Analysis and Partial Differential Equations, but currently, I am focused on passing my last qualifying exam.</p>

<p>Before coming to the University of Missouri, I attended the University of Alabama where I received a BS in Mathematics & Philosophy and an MA in Mathematics.</p>
