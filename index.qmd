My name is Jacob Lawrence. I am a first year graduate student at the University of Missouri. My interests primarily lie in Analysis (Functional and Harmonic Analysis).

Before the University of Missouri, I attended the University of Alabama where I recieved a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics & Philosophy and a Masters of Arts in Mathematics.
