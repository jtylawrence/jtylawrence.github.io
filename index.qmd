I am a third year PhD student at the University of Missouri, advised by Tanya Christiansen. Broadly speaking, my mathematical interests are in partial differential equations, especially spectral and scattering theory. 

Before coming to the University of Missouri, I finished a BS in Mathematics & Philosophy and an MA in Mathematics from the University of Alabama. 

My CV can be found [here](files/cv/jtylawrence_cv.pdf).
