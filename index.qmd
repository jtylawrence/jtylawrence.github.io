My name is Jacob Lawrence. I am a second year graduate student at the University of Missouri. My research interests primarily lie in Analysis and Partial Differential Equations, but currently, I am primarily focused on finishing my qualifying exams.

Before the University of Missouri, I attended the University of Alabama where I received a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics & Philosophy and a Masters of Arts in Mathematics.
