I am a second year PhD student at the University of Missouri. Primarily, I am interested in Analysis and Partial Differential Equations, but currently, I am focused on passing my last qualifying exam.

Before the University of Missouri, I attended the University of Alabama where I received a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics & Philosophy and a Masters of Arts in Mathematics.
