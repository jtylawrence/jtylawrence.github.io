I am a third year PhD student at the University of Missouri, advised by Tanya Christiansen. Broadly speaking, my research interests are in Partial Differential Equations, especially Spectral and Scattering Theory. 

Before coming to UM, I completed a BS in Mathematics & Philosophy and an MA in Mathematics from the University of Alabama. 

My CV can be found [here](files/cv/jtylawrence_cv.pdf).
