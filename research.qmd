Scattering Theory is the study of perturbations on wave propagation.

### Master's Work

For my master's degree, I completed a project titled [**The Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Function**](files/research/HardyLittlewoodMaximalFunction.pdf), advised by Kabe Moen.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    This project is primarily concerned with the sharp constants in the weak $(1,1)$ inequality and strong $(p,p)$ inequalities for the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. We begin by providing various (but equivalent) definitions of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. Afterwards, we prove the weak $(1,1)$ and strong $(p,p)$ inequalities (for $p>1$). Finally, we summarize known results and prove some of them.
