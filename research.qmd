**Interests**: Analysis; Partial Differential Equations; Scattering Theory

Scattering theory is the study of perturbations on wave propagation. While highly applicable to physics (especially quantum mechanics), I am particularly interested in the underlying mathematics. 

## Master's Work

While doing my master's degree, I completed a project on the sharp constants in the weak $(1,1)$ and strong $(p,p)$ inequalities for the Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Function. A copy of that paper can be found [here](files/research/HardyLittlewoodMaximalFunction.pdf). This was advised by Kabe Moen.
