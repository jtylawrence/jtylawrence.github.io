Scattering Theory is the study of perturbations on wave propagation.

### Master's Work

While doing my master's degree, I completed a project on the sharp constants in the weak $(1,1)$ and strong $(p,p)$ inequalities for the Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Function. A copy of that paper can be found [here](files/research/HardyLittlewoodMaximalFunction.pdf). This project was advised by Kabe Moen.
